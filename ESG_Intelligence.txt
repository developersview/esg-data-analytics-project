✅ Project Title
"ESG Data Intelligence Platform: Scalable ETL & Analytics on Databricks with Delta Lake, Power BI & Tableau"

📌 Project Summary
This project implements an end-to-end ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Data Intelligence Platform using Databricks, designed to support large-scale ingestion, transformation, and analysis of ESG metrics across companies and industries. The platform delivers curated ESG insights for business analysts, sustainability teams, and executive stakeholders through integrated dashboards built in both Power BI and Tableau.
The pipeline follows a robust Bronze–Silver–Gold Delta Lake architecture, and is fully orchestrated using Databricks Job Scheduler, ensuring regular updates and high data quality. It also includes data quality checks, automated test cases, and robust Python logging mechanisms for operational traceability.
This project mimics a real-world delivery model used by Big 4 consulting firms, combining Data Engineering best practices with Business Intelligence & Sustainability Analytics.

📈 Analytics Output & KPI Examples
KPI Name	Description
ESG Score (Normalized)	Weighted combination of E, S, G metrics
Carbon Emission Intensity	CO₂ emissions per revenue unit
Gender Diversity Ratio	% of female employees/board members
Board Independence %	Ratio of independent directors
ESG Risk Flag	Based on thresholds from Silver layer

🧪 Testing & Logging
Testing: Includes PyTest files to validate:

Schema integrity

Null value thresholds

Business rule accuracy (e.g., ESG score ≥ 0 and ≤ 100)

Logging:

Centralized logger with file + console handler

Captures job status, failures, data quality errors

Log rotation support to avoid size bloat

⏰ Scheduled Jobs (Databricks)
Modular pipeline notebooks are scheduled as Databricks Jobs:

Ingestion → Silver Transform → Gold Transform → KPI Analysis → Export

Jobs are parameterized for reusability and automation

Alerting (via email) can be added for job failure events

==========================================================================================================================
A bronze, silver, and gold layer data engineer project using Azure implements a medallion architecture for data processing, with each layer representing a stage of data refinement. Raw data resides in the bronze layer, cleaned and transformed data in the silver layer, and curated, aggregated data in the gold layer. Azure services like Data Factory, Databricks, and Synapse Analytics are commonly used to orchestrate and execute these transformations. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
Here's a breakdown of the project structure and Azure services involved: 
1. Bronze Layer (Raw Data): 

• Purpose: Stores data in its original format as ingested from source systems (e.g., CSV, JSON, databases). 
• Azure Services: 
	• Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2: Used for storing the raw data in its native format. 
	• Azure Data Factory (ADF): Used for orchestrating the initial data ingestion from various sources into the bronze layer. 
	• Example: ADF can be used to extract data from an Azure SQL database or an on-premises system and load it into Azure Data Lake Storage in CSV or JSON format. [1, 1, 4, 4, 5, 6]  

2. Silver Layer (Cleaned and Standardized Data): 

• Purpose: Cleans, transforms, and standardizes the raw data, applying data quality checks and preparing it for further analysis. [1, 2]  
• Azure Services: 
	• Azure Databricks: Utilized for data transformation using PySpark and other data processing frameworks. [1, 4]  
	• Delta Lake: Often used in conjunction with Databricks for efficient and reliable storage of transformed data. [7]  
	• Example: Databricks can be used to remove duplicates, handle missing values, apply schema validation, and perform data type conversions. [1, 4]  

3. Gold Layer (Curated and Aggregated Data): 

• Purpose: Aggregates and structures the data for specific analytical and reporting purposes, often using dimensional modeling and creating fact and dimension tables. [1, 1, 7, 7]  
• Azure Services: 
	• Azure Synapse Analytics: Can act as a data warehouse for storing the aggregated data and providing a SQL endpoint for querying. [1, 1, 4, 4]  
	• Power BI: Used for data visualization and creating dashboards on top of the curated data. [1, 1, 4, 4, 8, 9]  
	• Example: Aggregated sales data might be stored in the gold layer for reporting and analysis in Power BI, using a star schema or other dimensional models. [1, 1, 4, 4]  

Orchestration and Automation: 

• Azure Data Factory: Orchestrates the entire data pipeline, scheduling and monitoring the execution of different stages across the bronze, silver, and gold layers. 
• Example: ADF can trigger Databricks jobs to process data in the silver layer and then load the results into Synapse Analytics for the gold layer. [1, 4]  

Key Benefits of the Medallion Architecture: 

• Improved Data Quality: By processing data in stages, the architecture ensures that data is refined and cleansed at each step, leading to higher quality data in the gold layer. 
• Flexibility and Scalability: The modular nature of the architecture allows for easy modification and scaling of individual layers as needed. 
• Enhanced Data Accessibility: The gold layer provides a curated and structured view of the data, making it easier for business users to access and analyze the data. 
• Cost-Effectiveness: By processing data incrementally, the architecture can optimize resource utilization and potentially reduce costs. [1, 1, 2, 2, 10, 11]
